Unseen passages are introduced in the English subject to test the understanding and grasping power of the students. Usually, a passage is given to students, and they are asked to answer the questions based on the passage by reading it carefully. Mostly 2 passages are asked in the exam. With the new exam pattern, CBSE has introduced multiple-choice questions in the exam. So, some of the questions based on unseen passages are in the form of MCQs.
